# Firefox/Chrome extension: tone down web page colors for comfort and readability.

Unreadable text on a page? Unpleasant color scheme? Not enough contrast? Garish colors hurt your eyes? This extension will apply a lightweight, pastel style to aweb page, to make browsing more comfortable.

Four different, pleasant themes are available:
- browser default
- light
- sepia
- dark

Loosely based on the excellent "No Color" add-on for Firefox by SUN Chun-Yen, which is no longer supported.
